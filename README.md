# MapBuilderTool
A paint like project originally intended to be developed for level design in a grid based game.

This is Java application that uses JavaFX and its associated FXML files. It was made with paint like properties in mind so that a user could quickly create terrain on a game that uses a grid and overworld. It was abandoned in place of establish game development tools, in this case game maker studio, which already had the desired properties implemented.

How to Use:
This application runs similiarly to paint. You can save a load files, copy, cut, and paste, and go forward and backward in your actions with the menu bar or with common keyboard short cuts (ctrl-c, ctrl-x, ctrl-v, ctrl-z, ctrl-y).
